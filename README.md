# Onemax Problem
Onemax problem

This project is for solving <font color=red>one-max problem</font>.  
Exerting to clarify the code and making the structure to be clear and strong.  
If you have any suggestion, feel free to contact me.  
Thx! Have fun.  

Btw, this is the only public project, so if you are interested in other projects, send me correspondence.

<font color=red>Exhaustive Search (1)</font>  
Trying to search the possible answers as many as possible.  
Pros : No missing any possible solution.  
Cons : Wasting the computing capability. If possible solutions are unlimited, couldn't find the best answer anyway.  

-----
<font color=red>Hill Climbing (2)</font>  
Finding a better fitness solution nearby current one, and move toward to it.  
Pros : Can find a better solution nearby current one.  
Cons : It might easily trap into a local optimum.  
EX : There are two ways of transition. One is randonmly pick a position to change,
and another one is only check the left or right position based on decimal.  
  
Best,
